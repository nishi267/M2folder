I am passing a json hierarchy of classification where there is primry_driver and secondary_driver, in my prompt but th problrm and instructing the prompt to choose primary driver from call centre conversation context and then chosse the sub_driver under selected primary_driver, but model is still giving cross hierrachy combination for few sample like when a primary driver is selected the secondary driver selected is from differetnt primary_driver, how can I fix this hierarchy hallucination, my tempearture is 0.1


üîë Solutions to Prevent Cross-Hierarchy Hallucination
1. Constrain with Explicit Rules

Add a strict instruction in your system prompt:

‚ÄúA secondary_driver must always belong to the chosen primary_driver. Never select a secondary_driver from a different hierarchy node.‚Äù

Example schema reminder in the prompt helps too:

{
  "primary_driver": "Billing Issue",
  "secondary_driver": ["Wrong charge", "Late fee", "Invoice request"]
}

2. Force Schema with Structured Outputs

Instead of letting the model "free-type", use structured JSON output with allowed values. For example:

{
  "primary_driver": "<choose one from: [Billing, Technical Support, Cancellation]>",
  "secondary_driver": "<choose one ONLY from children of selected primary_driver>"
}


By enumerating allowed children in the prompt dynamically (depending on the chosen primary), you reduce leakage across hierarchies.

3. Stepwise Reasoning (Two-Turn Prompting)

Make the model first pick the primary driver, then in a second step, feed it only the children of that driver as possible secondary drivers.
This can be done with:

Chain-of-thought style prompting (internally two steps).

Or, in an API pipeline:

Step 1 ‚Üí Model outputs primary.

Step 2 ‚Üí Pass only that primary‚Äôs children into the context, and ask for secondary.

4. Use Function Calling / JSON Schema (Best Option if API Supports)

If you‚Äôre using the OpenAI API with function calling / JSON schema, you can enforce this hierarchy in the schema itself:

{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "primary_driver": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["Billing", "Technical Support", "Cancellation"]
    },
    "secondary_driver": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": []  // dynamically filled with children of selected primary_driver
    }
  },
  "required": ["primary_driver", "secondary_driver"]
}


This eliminates hallucination since the model is forced to select valid values.

5. Post-Validation (Guardrail Layer)

Even if the model outputs cross-hierarchy combos, you can add a validation layer:

Check if secondary_driver belongs to chosen primary_driver.

If not ‚Üí either re-ask the model, or auto-correct by discarding invalid matches.

‚úÖ Recommended hybrid:

Use Stepwise Reasoning + Validation Layer.

If API supports it, enforce function calling with dynamic schema (best guarantee).

üëâ Would you like me to draft a sample system prompt + stepwise implementation (for OpenAI function calling or pipeline) so you can directly plug it into your workflow?

steps prmpt:


You are a call center conversation classifier.

You are given a JSON hierarchy of drivers:
<hierarchy>

You must always follow these steps in order:

Step 1: Identify the single most relevant PRIMARY DRIVER from the conversation.
- Select ONLY from the top-level keys in <hierarchy>.
- Never invent new drivers.

Step 2: Once the PRIMARY DRIVER is selected, look up its list of secondary_driver options in <hierarchy>.
- Construct the list of valid secondary_driver values for this primary_driver.

Step 3: From that list, choose the most appropriate SECONDARY DRIVER.
- You MUST pick only from the valid list fetched in Step 2.
- Never select a secondary_driver from outside this list.

Step 4: If no exact secondary_driver matches, choose the closest valid one under the chosen primary_driver.
- Do NOT switch to another primary_driver.

Step 5: Output ONLY in strict JSON format:
{
  "primary_driver": "<selected primary>",
  "secondary_driver": "<selected secondary>"
}


-------

You must always return both primary_driver and secondary_driver. 
Do not leave either field blank or null. 
Choose the closest valid option if there is no perfect match.


"primary_driver": {
  "type": "string",
  "enum": ["Billing", "Technical Support", "Cancellation"],
  "minLength": 1
},
"secondary_driver": {
  "type": "string",
  "enum": ["Wrong charge", "Late fee", "Invoice request"],
  "minLength": 1
}

Step 4: Retry rule and fallback:
- If you cannot find an exact match, choose the closest valid option.
- If still uncertain, return "Other" from the chosen primary_driver‚Äôs list.
- Never select a secondary_driver from a different primary_driver branch.

Step 5: Output strictly in JSON:

Validation rules you must follow:
- If the selected secondary_driver is "Other", accept it as valid under the chosen primary_driver.
- If the selected secondary_driver is not listed under the chosen primary_driver, this is invalid.
  ‚Üí In that case, retry by selecting the closest valid secondary_driver from the correct list.
  ‚Üí If no suitable option exists, return "Other" instead.
- Never return null or blank values.
